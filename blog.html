    <section id="Tips for Growing Hair">        
            <h3>1. Keep Scalp Healthy and Clean</h3>
            <p>A healthy scalp is the foundation for hair growth. Cleanse your scalp regularly to remove buildup from products and oils, which can clog hair follicles and stunt growth. Use a gentle sulfate-free shampoo or a natural cleansing alternative like apple cider vinegar.</p>
            <h3>2. Moisturize Regularly</h3>
            <p>Natural hair tends to be drier than other hair types, so moisture is key. Keep your hair hydrated by using a leave-in conditioner, water-based moisturizers, and natural oils like coconut oil or shea butter. Deep condition your hair weekly to nourish and strengthen your strands.</p>
            <h3>3. Trim Split Ends</h3>
            <p>Although trimming might seem counterintuitive for growth, it’s essential to cut off damaged ends. Split ends can lead to breakage, preventing your hair from growing to its full potential. Trim your hair every 8–12 weeks to keep it healthy.</p>
            <h3>4. Protective Hairstyles</h3>
            <p>Low-manipulation hairstyles like braids, twists, and buns help to protect your hair from damage. These styles reduce breakage caused by everyday styling and help retain length.</p>
            <h3>5. Minimize Heat Usage</h3>
            <p>Excessive heat from styling tools can weaken your hair, leading to breakage. Limit your use of flat irons, blow dryers, and curling irons. If you must use heat, always apply a heat protectant to minimize damage.</p>
            <h3>6. Healthy Diet and Hydration</h3>
            <p>What you eat affects your hair’s health. Incorporate a balanced diet rich in vitamins, especially biotin, vitamins A, C, and E, and omega-3 fatty acids. Also, drink plenty of water to keep your body and hair hydrated from within.</p>
            <h3>7. Massage Your Scalp</h3>
            <p>Massaging your scalp stimulates blood flow to the hair follicles, encouraging hair growth. Use your fingertips or a scalp massager, and apply natural oils like castor oil or peppermint oil to further nourish your scalp.</p>

    <section id="daily-care">
        <h2>Daily Hair Care Routine</h2>
        <p>Establishing a daily hair care routine is crucial for maintaining healthy natural hair. Here are some essential steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Moisturize your hair every morning using a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Use a silk or satin scarf while sleeping to protect your hair.</li>
            <li>Detangle your hair gently using a wide-tooth comb or your fingers.</li>
            <li>Seal in moisture with natural oils like coconut or argan oil.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- New Section 4: Importance of Scalp Care -->
    <section id="scalp-care">
        <h2>Importance of Scalp Care</h2>
        <p>Scalp care is just as important as hair care when it comes to growth. Keeping your scalp healthy can prevent common issues like dryness, dandruff, and itchiness:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Massage your scalp regularly to promote blood circulation.</li>
            <li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo to keep your scalp clean without stripping its natural oils.</li>
            <li>Apply essential oils like tea tree oil or peppermint oil to soothe and nourish your scalp.</li>
            <li>Avoid tight hairstyles that pull on your scalp, leading to tension and potential hair loss.</li>
        </ul>
